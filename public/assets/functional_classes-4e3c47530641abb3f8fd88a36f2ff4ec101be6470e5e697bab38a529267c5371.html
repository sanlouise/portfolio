<p>A functional class is the simplest possible implementation of a class and 
can be used to produce fleets of similar objects that all conform to a somewhat 
similar interface.</p>

<h4>Decorators vs. Classes</h4>
  
<p>The main difference between a Decorator function and a class, is that a class 
builds the object it is going to use whereas a Decorator accepts that object as 
an input. This post will refer to and build upon the methods built in my former 
blog post dedicated to the Object Decorator Pattern.</p>
 
<p>
NOTE: this post elaborates upon the class and methods written in my former blog 
post on Object Decorators in Javascript. </br>
To build a functional class, we’ll need to rework our code a bit by moving the 
object creation into the tigerProps function and remove the obj parameter so that 
we can declare a local variable. Also, as of convention, we’ll need to capitalize 
all class names. Our library.js now looks as follows:
</p>
  
<pre><code>var Tiger = function(obj, loc) {
  obj.loc = loc;
  obj.move = function() {
    obj.loc++;
  };
  return obj;
};
</code></pre>

<p>And run.js:</p>

<pre><code>var bobo = Tiger(2);
bobo.move();
var nola = Tiger(7);
nola.move();

</code></pre>

<p>Functions within a class that produce a fleet of objects are called constructor functions. 
Their job is to construct the objects that will qualify as members of the class. The objects 
that are returned from constructor functions are called instances, and the process of creating 
a new object from a constructor function is called instantiating. </p>

<p>You might have noticed that every time Tiger is called, the move function runs as well - resulting 
in duplicated methods. Instead, we could use one function object that could be shared with all 
Tiger objects. We can push the move function outside of the class so it will only be referred to 
once, and thus only build one such function object (we have now a functional shared pattern!).</p>
  
<pre><code>var Tiger = function(loc) {
  obj.loc = {loc: loc};
  obj.move = move;
  return obj;
};

var move = function() {
  this.loc++;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I wrote this.loc++ instead of obj.loc++, because we moved the function out of the 
local scope of the Tiger class. Hopefully it is clear that ‘this’ refers to ‘the bobo' or ‘nola’ 
variables.</p>

<p>It is problematic, however, that we now refer to the move method in two places. For instance, if we 
were to add methods to make the tigers jump or run our code would look something like this:</p>
  
<pre><code>var Tiger = function(loc) {
  obj.loc = {loc: loc};
  obj.move = move;
  obj.jump = jump
  obj.run = run
  return obj;
};

var move = function() {
  this.loc++;
};

var jump = function() { … };
var run = function() { … };
</code></pre>

<p>This is much easier! Now, if we edit code in our Tiger.methods object, it will automatically become 
an available property to our Tiger class. Note, instead of naming it a global variable like ‘methods’, 
it is good practice to clearly name the methods object so it is clear what it belongs to.</p>
  
<p>My next blog post will iterate on improving this piece of code!</p>
