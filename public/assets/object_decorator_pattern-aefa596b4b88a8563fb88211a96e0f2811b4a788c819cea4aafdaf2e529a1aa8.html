<p>Whenever parts of your code have similarities, there is an 
opportunity to factor out these similar aspects into reusable code 
so you won’t have to violate the “Do not repeat yourself’ principle 
of software engineering. 
</p>

<h4>What does code reuse mean in practice?</h4>

<p>Reusing code means writing generalized code that can be used to address a 
variety of goals. Once you notice that parts of your code are similar, 
you probably can factor out these aspects and write the reusable code 
in a general library file so you won’t have to repeat yourself in the 
original places. 
</br>
Imagine that you are writing a simple game in which your player is walking 
on a road trying to avoid hungry tigers that just escaped from a zoo. The code 
of the loose tigers will have a lot in common and here we can use object-oriented 
patterns. 
</p>

<p>Let's get to practice! </p>
<p>In your code editor, create two files with names like ‘run.js’ and ‘library.js’. 
In run.js, let’s create an object that represents our first tiger, which I randomly 
called ‘bobo’.
</p>

<pre><code>var bobo = {};</code></pre>

<p>It is important to understand that ‘var bobo’ stands for the idea of a variable, 
whereas {} represents to idea of an in-memory object.
</br>
To keep track of the location of the tiger, we assign the property loc to bobo, and 
add bobo.loc++ on a new line to get the tiger to move (of course, code in actual games 
could look a lot more complicated, but let’s just stick to this to keep our example simple!). 
</br>
It is time to add another wild tiger to our game and call her ‘nola’! I also assigned 
different locations to both tigers. Our code now looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code>var bobo = {loc:2};
bobo.loc++;
var nola = {loc:7};
nola.loc++
</code></pre>

<p>Even though this is an amazingly simplified example, see that we are repeating ourselves? 
We are repeatedly building objects with a lot of common code. Let’s get to refactoring! 
</br>
We can write generalized code in library.js, and it would be a good start to write a function 
that moves the tigers along the street. Our code now looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>var move = function(tiger){
  tiger.loc++;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This function object can now operate on our simple tiger objects in run.js, which are also 
simplified to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>var bobo = {loc:2};
bobo(move);
var nola = {loc:7};
nola(move);
</code></pre>

<h4>Wait, why?</h4> 

<p>Hold on - why did we do this? Isn’t there more code now then when we started out? Actually, 
there are two good reasons to make the change we did.
</p>

<p>First, our example is extremely oversimplified. Usually writing generalized code will 
prevent programmers from rewriting much larger blocks of code. A second and maybe even more 
important reason is that now, if you want to change the way your objects move, you can be 
confident that you’ve made all the changes you need by editing the code in that single function. 
There is no need to make changes to each of your tiger objects. </p>

<p>We are not done yet! See that we are still repeating ourselves? It is this little piece: {loc:1}. 
Although the repeated code snippet is very tiny in our example, in practice this is rarely the 
case and objects usually have a lot more properties. Let’s move the property to our library.
</p>

<p>Again, we can write a function that does repeated work for us. I’ve called the function tigerProps 
because it contains the properties that the tiger needs to be considered a tiger object. Let’s 
write the function like this:
</p>

<pre><code>var tigerProps = function(obj, loc) {
  obj.loc = loc
  return obj;
};
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, ’obj’ refers to a tiger object as its input. When we call it to our tiger objects, 
we expect the tigerProps function to add the .loc property to the objects. We also passed the location 
of the tigers to the tigerProps function so it knows what to set the location to. We can now rewrite 
our code in run.js to look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>var bobo = tigerProps({}, 2);
bobo(move);
var nola = tigerProps({}, 9);
nola(move);</code></pre>

<p>The tigerProps function here is considered a Decorator.</p>

<h4>Can Decorators do more?</h4>

<p>We could call the move function bobo’ or ‘nola’ using dot notation, keeping in mind that functions 
can be used as properties to an object:
</p>

<pre><code>var bobo = tigerProps({}, 2);
bobo.move();
</code></pre>

<p>We will need to change the library.js file to match the following code: </p>

<pre><code>var tigerProps = function(obj, loc) {
  obj.loc = loc;
  obj.move = move;
  return obj;
};</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, we also need to make a small change to our move function. 
Since the function no longer takes a first argument, and instead takes the object 
on the left of the dot as its target when it is invoked. We’ll use ‘this’ to refer 
to this object on the left at calltime. </p>

<pre><code>var move = function() {
  this.loc++
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now the move function is available on all tigers! However, in our case it might 
be unnecessary store the move function as a global variable. Instead, we could move 
it right into the Decorator function by refactoring our code like this:</p>

<pre><code>var tigerProps = function(obj, loc) {
  obj.loc = loc;
  obj.move = function() {
    this.loc++;
  };
  return obj;
};
</code></pre>

<p>You could probably image though that this is not ideal either because with our 
current solution a new move function is generated (and these functions have their 
own identities that would not pass a strict comparison operator) every time the tigerProps 
function gets called. This could take up a lot of memory if we create many tiger objects!
</p>

<p>We could improve our function by changing the keyword ‘this’ to ‘obj’. Now, each time 
when we call the function a new closure scope is created and obj will always refer to the 
same tiger object.</p>

<p>My next blog post will interate on improving this piece of code!</p>
