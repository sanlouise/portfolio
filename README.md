### Welcome to the portfolio website of Sandra Hallie

The intention of this website is logging the projects and notes I've made during my 
journey to learn programming. After graduating from John Cabot University in 
Rome, Italy with degrees in International Affairs and Business Administration, 
I soon got addicted to learning as much as possible about new web technologies and frameworks.

Currently I live in the Netherlands, but I hope to move to the California Bay Area in 2016.
